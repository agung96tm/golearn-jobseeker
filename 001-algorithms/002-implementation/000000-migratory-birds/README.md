Migratory Birds
-------------------------------
Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.

### Example:
```
[in]  
1 4 4 4 5 3

[out] 
4
```

```
[in]  
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 3 4

[out]
3
```
